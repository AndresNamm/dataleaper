## What i did

1. .venv is the standard convention for python virtual environments.
2. did renaming of python module to snake_case to follow python conventions. fixed import paths in streamlit/app.py accordingly.


## Recommendations

1. add some test data files for stanford classic pri/prd and stanford 2010 hpr formats and simple test scripts to verify parsers work. reference in README.md as this is usefule to understand how to use the parsers.

# Text

1. Would recommend to use markdown to write initial article draft and then convert to latex for final submission. I can show you how its done. It unlocks version control and ability to really easily leverage power of LLM tools for writing assistance.
