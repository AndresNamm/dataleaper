# Quick Recommendation (Child: 16 kg / 95 cm / 2 yr)

*   **The Weight Limit Problem:** Your child is 16 kg. Most "Standard" ISOFIX seats stop at 18 kg.
*   **Best Value/Safety:** **Axkid Minikid 4** or **BeSafe Stretch** (Up to 36 kg). These are the only seats guaranteed to last until your child is 6-7 years old.
*   **Best Convenience:** **Axkid One 3** (Up to 23 kg). Easier ISOFIX installation and will last 2-3 years longer than standard seats.
*   **Forward Facing:** **Cybex Anoris T2**. Safest forward option (airbag), but has the lowest weight limit (21 kg) of this group.
    *   **Why is forward facing generally worse?** In a frontal crash (the most common type), a forward-facing child's head is thrown forward, putting immense strain on the undeveloped neck and spine. Rear-facing seats absorb these forces into the seat shell, which is why they are considered up to 5x safer.
*   **Rotational / Convertible:** **Cybex Sirona S**. convenient 360 rotation. **Warning:** The *European* version often stops at 18 kg (105 cm), which your child is nearly too heavy for. The *US* version goes higher, so double-check the specific model's sticker carefully before buying.
